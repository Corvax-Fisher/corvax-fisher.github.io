# Portfolio

Hello, my name is Martin Heller and this is my portfolio page.  
On this page, I will present some projects I was involved in.

## Grey Spring / Spring it out!

This project was created by Yannick and me in the course of a game jam at the Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen, a university of applied sciences, located in Friedberg (Hessen), Germany. It was hosted November 18-21, 2016.

It is available for 
- [WebGL (play now)](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/Z1SBocOEez/)
- [Android (download)](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/b1Mu7LrNeM/)

- [Mac OS (universal) (download)](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/ZyOvp9O4lG/)
- [Linux (universal) (download)](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/-ka0C5dNxf/)

It is best played on Android with the accelerometer by tilting the smartphone.  
On other platforms it is played by using the **WASD keys**.  
One can get it for Android simply by scanning this QR code:

## Mosaics

This project was created by Farah, Sebastian and me during our master's degree studies of media informatics.  
- It is a web based game where the goal is to solve a mosaics puzzle by using as few commands as possible.  
- It was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, PHP, and XML.  
- It was tested for Firefox and Chrome.
